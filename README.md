# Software Architecture Design Patterns :white_check_mark:
[1] Software Architecture Design Patterns according to Partha Kuchana's book.  

There are multiple design patterns that allow the handling of common problems in software development.

## Objective :telescope:

Build and comprehend design pattern implementations in Java

## *Creational Patterns* :construction:
### [Singleton](https://github.com/lsofiadb/Software-Architecture-Design-Patterns/tree/main/SingletonWithGUI) :one:
<p>Provides a controlled object creation mechanism to ensure that only one instance of a given class exists [1].</p>

### [Factory Method](https://github.com/lsofiadb/Software-Architecture-Design-Patterns/tree/main/FactoryMethodWithGUI) :factory:
<p text-align="justify">When a client object does not know which class to instantiate, it can make use of the factory method to create an instance of an appropriate class from a class hierarchy or a family of related classes. The factory method may be designed as part of the client itself or in a separate class.
The class that contains the factory method or any of its subclasses decides on which class to select and how to instantiate it [1].</p>
